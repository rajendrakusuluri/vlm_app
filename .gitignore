# Ignore empty directories
# This is a bit tricky, as Git doesn't track empty directories.
# The best approach is to prevent them from being created in the first place.
# You can use `.gitkeep` files in directories that *must* exist.  If you
# still want to include the directories use the following pattern to keep them
# from showing changes, but not prevent them from being staged:
# */
